New Features, significant changes

* Reset tape only resets the count. There are other methods for 
  resetting z values, but there wasn't a way to reset count only
  (= reload the tape)
* Movement tests do only one move per click to prevent crash
  if motor stalls
* Added a "Measure and set" homing button, that relatively quickly
  corrects drift: Machine goes to zero, and measures the homing mark.
  Result should be zero, but isn't, so coordinates are set to the difference.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed unwanted move in place assissted mode
* Fixed issues in rotation and already placed status handling in placement
* Better diagnostics on failed homing
* More robust camera stream handling
